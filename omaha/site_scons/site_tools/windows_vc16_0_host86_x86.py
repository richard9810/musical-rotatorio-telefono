"""Tool-specific initialization for Visual Studio 2017.

NOTE: This tool is order-dependent, and must be run before
any other tools that modify the binary, include, or lib paths because it will
wipe out any existing values for those variables.

There normally shouldn't be any need to import this module directly.
It will usually be imported through the generic SCons.Tool.Tool()
selection method.
